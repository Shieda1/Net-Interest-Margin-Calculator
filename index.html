    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the net interest margin<br> 
    What is the net interest margin?<br>
    the net interest margin is a formula that is used to reveal the amount of money that a bank is earning in interest on loans compared to the amount it is paying in interest on deposits and it is considered an indicator of a bank'sprofitability and growth.<br>
    How to calculate net interest margin?<br>
    To calculate net interest margin you should use the following formula:<br>
    net interest margin = (investment inccome - interest expenses) / average earning assets<br>
    example: bank x takes a loan for $310,000 for an interest rate of 8% annualy and the bank earns $350,000 at the end of the year, what is the net interest margin?<br>
    investment income = $350,000 - $310,000 = $40,000<br>
    interest expenses = 0.08 * $310,000 = $24,800<br>
    using the interest margin formula the answer will be:<br>
    net interest margin = (investment income - interest expenses) / average earning assets<br>
    net interest margin = ($40,000 - $24,800) / $310,000<br>
    net interest margin = 4.9%<br>
    Why use the net interest margin?<br>
    the net interest margin is used to indicate a bank's profitability and growth.<br>
